QueNcert: A Queueing System for Onsite Ticket Sales for Ticket Distributors in Shopping Malls

QueNcert is a queueing program designed to effectively manage lineups at malls where tickets are being sold
on the spot. It launches a system that directs customers to different ticket counters in accordance with 
the section of the venue they intend to reside in.

## Objectives
- Obtain the personal information of the customers upon
arrival at the site before the actual ticket selling,
- Identify their preferred section and assign them to their
respective ticket booths,
- Display tables that separate queues of the different sections
in the concert hall.

The proponents utilized Java as their main programming language and will implement Java Swing Gui, a GUI 
with several unique widgets and features that can be employed to build the desired window configuration.

The sections are divided into five out of six specifically VIP Standing, VIP Seated, Lowerbox, Upperbox, Gen Ad, and Generic
